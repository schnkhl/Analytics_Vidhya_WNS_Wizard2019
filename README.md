## Problem Statement
Zbay is an E-commerce website which sells a variety of products at its online platform. Zbay records user behaviour of its customers and stores it as a log. However, most of the times, users do not buy the products instantly and there is a time gap during which the customer might surf the internet and maybe visit competitor websites.
 
Now, to improve sales of products, Zbay has hired Adiza, an Adtech company which built a system such that ads are being shown for Zbay’s products on its partner websites.
 
If a user comes to Zbay’s website and searches for a product, and then visits these partner websites or apps, his/her previously viewed items or their similar items are shown on as an ad. If the user clicks this ad, he/she will be redirected to the Zbay’s website and might buy the product.

* In this problem, the task is to predict click probability i.e. probability of user clicking the ad which is shown to them on the partner websites for the next 7 days on the basis of historical view log data, ad impression data and user data.
